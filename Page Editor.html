                <p> The Governments around the world enforced massive school closures in an attempt to stop the virus's spread, upsetting the regular learning around billions of students worldwide. Therefore due to the unavailability of physical classrooms, remote learning quickly gained popularity, mostly relying on digital tools and online learning environments which weren't as good as physical classrooms. <br><br> 
                    Due to this effect many students, especially those from underprivileged families or with limited access to educational resources, suffered severe learning loss as a result of prolonged school closures and the difficulties associated with remote learning. In some cases this led to even worse scenarios as the isolation, unpredictability, and disruption which had a negative impact on students, teachers, and families mental health and wellbeing, increasing stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.<br><br>
