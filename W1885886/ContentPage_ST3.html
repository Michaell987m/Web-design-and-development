                <P> The world was already far behind when it comes to meeting its education goals even before the COVID-19 pandemic, However now we are making sure that all boys and girls receive free, fair, high-quality primary and secondary education by 2030, resulting in a learning more educated society in the future.<br><br> 
                    We will also make sure that by 2030, every young person and a significant percentage of adults men and women alike are literate and numerate. Therefore a larger percentage of the population will have better access to education and opportunities in a more fair society. It may enable people to fully engage in political, social, and economic spheres, fostering the advancement and development of society as a whole.<br><br>

            <div class = "Pandemic-text">
                <P> The Governments around the world enforced massive school closures in an attempt to stop the virus's spread, upsetting the regular learning around billions of students worldwide. Therefore due to the unavailability of physical classrooms, remote learning quickly gained popularity, mostly relying on digital tools and online learning environments which weren't as good as physical classrooms. <br><br> 
                    Due to this effect many students, especially those from underprivileged families or with limited access to educational resources, suffered severe learning loss as a result of prolonged school closures and the difficulties associated with remote learning. In some cases this led to even worse scenarios as the isolation, unpredictability, and disruption which had a negative impact on students, teachers, and families mental health and wellbeing, increasing stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.<br><br>

                <P> In order to improve global Sustainability we will make sure that by 2030 every student has the knowledge and abilities necessary to advance sustainable development. This includes teaching them about sustainable lifestyles and sustainable development, human rights, gender equality, and the promotion of nonviolence culture and peace, as well as global citizenship, appreciation of cultural diversity, and the role that culture plays in advancing sustainable development.<br><br> 
                    Achieving greater sustainability will imply responsible management and conservation of environmental resources, promoting resilience against climate change and biodiversity loss. This will Prioritize social justice and equity which helps to guarantee that everyone has access to necessities like food, water, healthcare, and education.
